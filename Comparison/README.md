# Setup
- Made agar with 100mL buffer and ~ 0.7g of agarose
- Used Laser diodes G2 and G3, which had similar characteristics
- Powered at the same time via the same PWM circuit
- Camera settings:
	- Aperture: F1.7
	- Exposure time : 1/500 s
	- ISO: 50

# Results
- First setup (columns 1 and 2) compares Newport fibers, not etched vs etched
- Second setup (columns 3 and 4) compares etched fibers, [Newport](https://www.newport.com/p/F-MBB) vs [Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FP200URT)
